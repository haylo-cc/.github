> Haylo is still currently in development

How does it work?
It's currently a Visual Studio Code extension that tracks your code & how you code then ranks you out of ten in the following categories.

- Codinng Erros
- Key Strokes Per Minute (KPM)
- Active Coding Time (How much time spent actually typing code during a session)
- AI Dependency
- Code Readability
- Code Duplication

From these statistics, Haylo can provide activities based on key concepts you've tripped up on in your code. For example, if you keep making erros related to React useStates, Haylo might reccomend a react useState activity
