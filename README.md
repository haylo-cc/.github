üöÄ Haylo is an interactive platform built for developers by developers to supercharge their developemnt.
> Haylo is currently in development, things are subject to change

# How does it work?
It's currently an IDE Extension that tracks your code & how you code then ranks you out of ten in the following categories.

- Coding Errors
- Key Strokes Per Minute (KPM)
- Active Coding Time (How much time spent actually typing code during a session)
- AI Dependency
- Code Readability
- Code Duplication

From these statistics, Haylo can provide activities based on key concepts you've tripped up on in your code. For example, if you keep making errors related to React useStates, Haylo might reccomend a react useState activity. It works with all coding languages and is completely free.

# What's the point?
In the midst of an AI pandemic, it can be hard for developers to improve on their own when they have AI tools at their disposal. Haylo provides a way for developers to keep in check and continue growing.

# ü§î Is Haylo Open Source?
At the moment, no. No parts of Haylo are open source. As we grow, we plan on sharing our algrothims and log file standards to empower other developers to create solutions that help better others

# üîê Privacy & Security
Haylo uses AI to process results, this is done for free, forever. We dont collect information on your code, but how you code. Any information about your code is proccesed in your IDE and isnt sent back to Haylo unless you let us. You can request & delete all the data we have on you at anytime.

# How can I get involved
Get started using the beta at haylo.cc
