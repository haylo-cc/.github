Haylo is an interactive platform built for Mobile & the web, that gives developers key insights on how they code based of 6 key metrics
> Haylo is currently in development, things are subject to change

# How does it work?
It's currently an IDE Extension that tracks your code & how you code then ranks you out of ten in the following categories.

- Codinng Erros
- Key Strokes Per Minute (KPM)
- Active Coding Time (How much time spent actually typing code during a session)
- AI Dependency
- Code Readability
- Code Duplication

From these statistics, Haylo can provide activities based on key concepts you've tripped up on in your code. For example, if you keep making erros related to React useStates, Haylo might reccomend a react useState activity

# Is Haylo Open Source?
At the moment, no. No parts of Haylo are open source. As we grow we plan on sharing our algrothims and log file standards to empower other developers to create solutions that help better others

# Privacy & Security
Haylo uses AI to process results, this is done for free, forever. We dont collect information on your code, but how you code. Any information about your code is proccesed in your IDE and isnt sent back to Haylo unless you let us. You can request & delete all the data we have on you at anytime.
